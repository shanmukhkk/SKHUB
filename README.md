# SKHUB
This website serves as a visual prototype of a professional networking platform, thoughtfully designed to showcase the structure and flow of key features commonly found in such applications. It visually presents core components such as user registration and login pages and profile dashboards with editable sections. A key highlight is the integration of a dynamic, interactive map powered by Leaflet.js, allowing users to find and explore venue locations with map markers and zoom functionality. While the interface reflects the look and feel of a functional platform, several features are implemented primarily for UI demonstration purposes and may not perform real-time backend operations. Built with Python for backend logic and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the prototype delivers a responsive and intuitive user experience. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages to showcase design layout, feature placement, and front-end integration as part of a development-focused presentation.
